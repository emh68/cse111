"""Many vehicle owners record the fuel efficiency of their vehicles as a way to track the health of 
the vehicle. If the fuel efficiency of a vehicle suddenly drops, there is probably something wrong 
with the engine or drive train of the vehicle. In the United States, fuel efficiency for gasoline 
powered vehicles is calculated as miles per gallon. In most other countries, fuel efficiency is 
calculated as liters per 100 kilometers. The formula for computing fuel efficiency in miles per 
gallon is the following:

mpg = end âˆ’ start / gallons

where start and end are both odometer values in miles and gallons is a fuel amount in U.S. gallons.
The formula for converting miles per gallon to liters per 100 kilometers is the following:

lp100k = 235.215 / mpg"""
