# CSE 111: Programming with Functions

## Course Overview
CSE 111 teaches students how to become **organized, efficient, and powerful programmers** by:
- Researching and calling functions
- Writing, calling, debugging, and testing their own functions
- Handling errors within functions
- Solving problems across disciplines like business, physical science, human performance, and humanities

### Prerequisites
Before starting CSE 111, students must complete one of the following:
- **CSE 110**: Programming Building Blocks
- **CS 101**: Introduction to Programming
- **CIT 160**: Introduction to Programming  
- A minimum score of 110 on the LUC test

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will:
1. Write and call functions to accomplish meaningful tasks in a variety of domains.
2. Research and use libraries and objects.
3. Write programs that handle errors and recover from invalid conditions.
4. Follow good practices in designing, writing, and debugging functions.

---

## Topics Covered
1. **Functions**: Parameters, default values, variable scope, and return values.
2. **Testing**: Using `pytest` to validate functions.
3. **Error Handling**: Try/Except blocks, error recovery.
4. **Data Structures**:
   - Lists and dictionaries
   - Text and CSV files
5. **Functional Programming**:
   - Lambda functions
   - Higher-order functions like `map()` and `filter()`
6. **Using Objects**: Attributes, methods, and object-oriented practices.

## Course Organization
CSE 111 is divided into lessons that follow this structure:
1. **Prepare**: Learn from articles and videos.
2. **Prepare: Checkpoint**: Practice concepts through small coding tasks.
3. **Teach: Team Activity**: Solve programming activities in teams.
4. **Prove**: Complete individual programming assignments.
5. **Ponder**: Reflect on the learning process through quizzes.
